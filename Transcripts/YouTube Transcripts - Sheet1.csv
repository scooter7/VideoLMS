having good communication skills is
fundamental to success in many aspects
of life it can help you from personal to
professional life and in many other
situations people who have good
communication skills will see better
productivity and improved relationships
in every aspect of their lives according
to a survey by the National Association
of Colleges and employers communication
skills are recorded as the most
important quality looked for in job
candidates here are 12 effective tips
you can use to improve your
communication skills tip number 1 learn
to listen listen more than you talk
Richard Branson when communicating with
others we often focus on what we should
say however effective communication is
less about talking and more about
listening the better you listen the
better you are at communication first
listen to what others have to say and
then you can provide a thoughtful answer
that shows you have taken those ideas
into account don't just wait for their
mouth to stop moving to make your point
listening is not the same thing as
hearing learning to listen means making
it a point to listen closely to not just
the words they speak but also to their
body language and the emotions they're
displaying if a speaker can see and feel
that someone is listening and
understanding that can help build a
stronger deeper relationship between
conversationalist s' tip number 2 pay
attention to body language your
nonverbal communication cues the way you
look listen move and react to another
person tells them more about how you're
feeling than words alone ever can when
you're nonverbal signals match up with
the words you're saying they increase
trust clarity and rapport when they
don't they can generate tension mistrust
and confusion they
SiC rules for good body language when
communicating include feeling relaxed at
all times avoiding crossing your arms
always making eye contact and taking
your hands out of your pocket while you
speak this helps the other person know
that they have your full attention and
that you are open to a two-way
conversation if you want to become a
better communicator it's important to
become more sensitive not only to the
body language and nonverbal signals of
others but also to your own tip number 3
show respect people have different
opinions different abilities and
different talents respectful
communication involves the ability to
effectively assert your own views and
fully listen to the views of others if
you respect the ideas and opinions of
others they will be more likely to
communicate with you active listening or
simply using the name of the person you
are speaking to can both be effective
don't multitask while communicating
avoid using your phone make eye contact
use people's names and make sure what
you've said is professional and
respectful basically be a human tip
number 4 maintain eye contact some are
blue and some are green some are brown
and others hazel that's right the
subject is eyes but more importantly
than the color of someone's eyes is what
their eyes are saying eye contact is a
type of body language that is extremely
important during communication and
conversation sometimes our eyes and body
language speak even more than our words
when you keep eye contact with a person
to whom you are talking it shows that
you are focused and paying attention it
means that you are actually listening to
what the person has to say avoiding eye
contact shows that you are not paying
attention to what the other person is
saying it could mean that you may not
like the person and you don't want to
continue the conversation anymore these
are the negative effects of avoiding eye
contact sometimes the other person might
read it wrongly and therefore produce a
negative feeling towards you as well tip
number 5 ask questions asking questions
is a powerful tool in community
questioning is a very good way of
starting a conversation and keeping it
going it is also a very good way of
obtaining more information about a
particular topic asking questions also
shows that you are paying attention to
what the other person is saying because
you tend to spend far more time drawing
information out from others than
broadcasting your own opinions by asking
questions you learn more and that helps
you build stronger personal and
professional relationships tip number
six have emotional awareness emotions
play a major role in effective
communication with others emotional
awareness or the ability to understand
and manage your emotions will help you
succeed when communicating with other
people if you have emotional awareness
you will communicate more effectively
you will also better understand what the
other person is communicating to you and
why sometimes understanding how a person
is communicating with you is more
important than what is actually being
said sometimes we try to hide our
feelings but why that's because emotions
don't lie instead of trying to hide your
feelings focus on becoming aware of your
feelings and the feelings of those
around you in order to be a better
communicator tip number seven avoid
interrupting interrupting is the
ultimate conversation killer sometimes
people have problems with interrupting
others with constant interruptions
effective communication is almost
impossible when we interrupt someone it
usually means we are not listening and
paying attention to what they are saying
interrupting has two unfortunate
outcomes first we don't get to hear what
the other person was going to say which
might have been some useful information
second it most likely damages the rest
of the conversation because when you
interrupt a person it makes them feel
they haven't been heard and can cause
them to shut down entirely if you want
to be a good communicator avoid
interrupting because it will reduce the
power and effectiveness of your
communication tip number eight keep
positive an important aspect of good
communication skills is the ability to
communicate positively no matter how
upset and stressed you are try to stay
positive because no one wants to be
around someone who is miserable and
depressed do your best to be positive
and friendly with other people maintain
a positive cheerful attitude when you
always maintain a positive attitude
people would love to listen and talk to
you all the time and also respond
positively to you tip number 9 speak
clearly speaking effectively is defined
as speaking in such a way that your
message is clearly heard speaking
clearly is a major part of communication
some people tend to speak in a very low
voice others are naturally soft-spoken
and there are those so fast that one
word gets blurred into the next whatever
your speaking style is if people have
difficulty hearing what you are saying
you can be sure you are not speaking
clearly when listeners struggle to
understand you they eventually ignore
you enhancing clarity not only
strengthens your communication skills it
improves your image and makes others
more responsive to your message tip
number 10 avoid using your phone it is
very rude to use your phone while
someone is talking to you while you are
having a conversation with someone avoid
using your phone look at the person who
is talking to you and pay attention to
what he or she is saying using your
phone while you are talking decreases
the quality of what you talk about a lot
of people have the habit of using their
phone while communicating don't be that
kind of a person and if you have to take
an important call while talking to
someone excuse yourself first
remember no one is more important than
the person you are speaking to at the
moment tip number 11 think before you
speak
thinking before you speak is a really
good habit to develop to avoid causing
problems in your life whether it's in
your relationships career or elsewhere
on the other hand speaking before you
think is a bad habit that can get you
into trouble
and hurt you in the most important areas
of your life Napoleon Hill said think
twice before you speak because your
words and influence will plant the seed
of either success or failure in the mind
of another after you've listened and
understood pause take a deep breath and
take time to draft in your head what you
want to say avoid saying the first thing
that comes to your mind tip number 12
avoid filler words words such as like
well you know um I guess and uh are
meaningless and really have no value in
any conversation instead of using these
filler words take time relax and pause a
little before speaking for example if
someone were to ask you how was your
trip to Turkey instead of saying well it
was fun uh I enjoyed it a lot take time
pause and say it was fun I enjoyed it a
lot good communication skills can play

Communication Skills,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAf9GxHzlmw,"hey welcome back to the Justice scholar
I am uh looking forward to talking to
you today and we're talking about a good
one today uh
communication that gets uh that area for
a lot of high schoolers is a place that
creates a lot of uh strife and struggle
and and challenges in their lives one
reason I think that that occurs is
because this is such a pivotal time
uh for you young High young people high
schoolers you're beginning to understand
that there's different audiences and
you're beginning to engage with
different folks right you know you know
you have your have peer group friends
you have your interestes you know people
that you're attracted to you have your
teachers your
coaches you have uh your parents and
then you're embarking or looking to
Embark in another uh place um you know
work school or some type of government
program and uh you have to go in I
encourage you each to go into this um
area of communication with a a
strong head on your shoulder with a
strong mindset with you because it it's
a lot to you know to talk to different
folks
and talk to different people throughout
your day and you have a different
relationship with them and so you
participate in conversations in
different ways and this isn't to say
that
you're fake or phony um in these
conversations or in these uh engagements
but it is to recognize that in a
specific setting that specific uh
communication rule
um come up and are important
to uh function by that it allows the
trading of information the
the trading of um yeah of information to
occur in the setting and in the into
interaction and allow for that
interaction to be pleasant for you know
all people's
involved that's uh is even hard for me
to communicate but um to share with you
in this video but it it is a tough thing
to to recognize what's going on when you
see it but also to participate in it uh
as as you will be doing you know when
you uh embark on life and when you
embark on uh whatever area of life you
begin first um you you're going to learn
you're going to make trials and errors
you're going to see that um
communication is both a hard skill and
soft skill so you have communication as
a hard skill uh when it comes to
documentation when it comes to um
students that uh high school students
that transition to college you know
write in write in your uh course papers
and assignments uh for students that are
um going
to trade school or going to work right
away you know talking to your colleagues
interacting with your instructor
interacting with uh clients or or
community members depending on your work
and then uh in the course of uh
government related programs like uh
military communication is very key
because um it's done in in a particular
fashion right um where you have to
recognize these rules and that there is
um based on the said there is a wrong
way to communicate and so
um just to say you know context matters
the person who you're talking to matters
the what you're trying to communicate
matters um and so you you definitely
have to um Factor those um elements in
when deciding uh what you say how you
say it and when you say it um
additionally there are
the other element of communication right
the the the softer skills of
communication U when it comes to your
tone
speed um when it comes to word selection
when it comes to
um where selection can be thought of as
tone but word selection can also be
thought of um I mean excuse me yeah word
selection can be thought of as tone
which gets translated into hard skill
but word selection can also be um a part
of the soft skills excuse me tone can be
a part of the soft skills if you think
of tone as volume you know how high or
or low how fast or slow that you end up
speak um speaking and sharing
information with others um so tone is a
bit of a tricky one but it can fall on
both ends as a hard skill of
communication and a soft skill of
communication what I um really want to
say more about the soft skill of
communication those are just as um
varying as the hard skills right and and
they're ones that you're going to get
wrong um partially because of those
reasons that I just mentioned right it
comes to who you're talking to it comes
to what you're talking about it comes to
um when or where you're you're trying to
talk with others but it also um and this
is about the softc it also has to do
with h cultural differences and with
being here in the United States and as a
person that has lived in two different
regions for about the same amount of
time that is a area that is so
understated um I'm from the US South
I've spent uh 20 22 years there I've
been uh I got my um higher education my
masters in PhD in the
southwest which has its own different
history a bit of a different culture and
U what is considered to
be common in one place isn't common in
another what is um as far as like
cultural norms what is meant to be uh
inviting uh engaging uh
supportive um um an uplift to uh the
communication experience may not be
viewed as the same elsewhere and so that
is definitely something to uh keep in
mind and and partially why
um
education
is I advocate for it um on any front not
for uh education sake you know to to get
a degree and so forth and get a good job
but it allows you a moment to really
experience and test out these different
circumstances whe like I said whether
the education is through a government
funded programmed education is through
the um working environment um there's
learning experiences there or education
through the university college system
setting it gives you a moment to learn
these Norms um and to try and fail
because that's part of learning to to
try it out and fail at these experiences
and so
um and to also figure out what
communication tips tricks and and
thoughts are right for your setting for
your industry for your your organization
and that's um something you pick up on
through experience right the longer
you're there the more you um pick up on
on on trends that are specific to your
organization but it is also um in this
age where you may need to
um move to a different organization that
you learn and you begin to see that um
how these differences really show up and
and make it for a different workplace um
make it make for a different work itself
uh and outcomes but also uh how you a
engage and and work with others in that
organization and so uh for you high
schoolers out there I would say focus on
especially at the the stage that you're
at focus on the basics you
know work on your
writing which also goes hand in hand
with work on your reading if it's
business writing you want to improve do
some more reading of business writing um
if you want to improve your verbal
communication skills or presentation
skills give more presentations go uh
volunteer to go to the conferences you
will definitely so sorry about that um
you'll definitely pick up more and more
uh skills as you get to do the work in
in real time and so I'll leave you there
today and tomorrow we'll be talking
about some more great uh ideas and
skills that hopefully you'll um grasp or
at least get a chance to practice in
high school and and we'll keep going and
involving this uh discussion in uh
helping you my my goal is to help you
and support you through your journey and
and help you um supplement
uh the many lessons that you get within
the classroom within your school and to
really um highlight whatever I can to to
make that time really successful for you
we'll get to talking about college but
right now um as I mentioned in one of my
earlier videos you know it begins it
begins um in high school getting
prepared for college getting prepared
for graduate school doctoral program
master's degree it it really is um U it
begins in high school and it's such a
high school is such a pivotal time for
solidifying some things in you and and
realizing
what big idea what things you um would
like to spend your time on and what you
you don't want to spend your time on and
I'm here to help support you uh in
whatever you end up going to to have
some really good foundational skills for
succeeding in those different areas all
right talk to you later"
